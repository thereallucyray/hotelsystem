        <header>Iteration 2 Materials:</header>
        <p>
        Implementation status:<br>
        We (all team members) have implemented most utility classes necessary for the scope of this 
        project. Brendon specifically has been focusing on a lot of the back end utilities, and has 
        been creating database tools that interact with csv files. We have created additional System
        Handler and UI classes to decouple the application and domain logic layers from the UI layer.
        <br><br>
        For this iteration, we have focused on creating the graphical user interface for the Hotel Clerk view. 
        We have completed the UI and App logic for the “Clerk Reserves a Room for a Guest” use case, as well 
        as the “Clerk Registers a Guest” use case. The GUI for the “Modify Room” use case has also been created,
        that allows an employee to change what kind of room an existing hotel room is (e.g. a room that was 
        previously a non-smoking suite is changed to be a smoking economy room). We have decided that the 
        “Add Room” use case does not make much logical sense at this stage, because theoretically no new hotel 
        rooms are being created, they should already exist in the database. 
        <br><br>
        There were no major roadblocks in completing this iteration.
