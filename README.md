# hotelsystem

This project has been created by Group 5: Priscilla Leafblad, Brendon Kofink, Misty Kurien, Lucy Ray and Ciara Woodahl for csi 3471.

This application is a Hotel Reservation Management System meant for the local desktop. 
It was coded in java and uses java swing to create the UI.

# USAGE
For testing purposes, we have made accounts for various levels that can be used to log in to the system.
* Guest: 
  * Username: uberguest
  * Password: password
* Employee:
  * Username: employee1
  * Password: password
* Admin
  * Username: admin1
  * Password: superduperpassword
  
If these are not working,
1. Make sure you have checked is employee if you are trying to log in as either the employee of admin.
2. Reset the database by deleting the .db folder in your current working directory
3. Email brendon_kofink2@baylor.edu I swear it works.
